<body>
Extending first example. Checkbox selection added. At the moment standard ag-grid does not provide "select all"/"deselect all" check box at header row.
So in that example we add that feature with custom header renderer and using GridApi. Take a notice that `Select all` take into account current filter.
That sample also demonstrate localization (russian localization applied)
